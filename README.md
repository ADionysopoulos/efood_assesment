# Project README - Analyzing Coupon Effects on Customer Behavior
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of coupon campaigns on customer behavior using Google BigQuery. The primary code file for the analysis is "BigQuery_bquxjob_4268ce04_18b9ad7f5ea.ipynb," and the project findings are presented in the PowerPoint presentation file "efood presentation assessment.pptx."

## Project Files
BigQuery_bquxjob_4268ce04_18b9ad7f5ea.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used for the analysis. It includes data processing, SQL queries, and data visualization to assess the effects of coupon campaigns on customer behavior.

efood presentation assessment.pptx: This PowerPoint presentation file summarizes the key findings and insights from the analysis. It includes visualizations and explanations to effectively communicate the results to stakeholders.

## Analysis Process
1) Data Extraction: The project begins by extracting relevant data from the efood dataset.

2) Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is performed to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values and data transformation.

3) Coupon Impact Analysis: The Jupyter Notebook contains code to analyze the impact of coupon campaigns on customer behavior. This involves identifying key metrics such as order frequency, order amount, and coupon redemption patterns.

4) User Class Segmentation: Users are categorized into different classes based on their behavior, and the analysis is conducted for each user class.

5) Presentation: The results and insights are presented in the PowerPoint presentation to effectively communicate the findings to stakeholders.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the impact of coupon campaigns on customer behavior, allowing for data-driven decision-making in marketing strategies. The code and presentation are available for reference and further discussions with stakeholders.
